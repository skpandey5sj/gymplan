**Explanation of Design Decisions:**
1. Color Scheme:
    --Used a gradient-based background to enhance visual appeal.
    --The primary color is blue (#007bff), maintaining a professional and modern look.
    --The background for cards and form is a subtle light gradient to provide depth and contrast.
2. Typography:
   --Used Bootstrap's default fonts for readability.
   --Headers are bold and slightly larger to ensure clarity and emphasis.
3. Layout Choices:
        --Hero Section: Engaging introduction with a background image/video.
        --Feature Section: Organized in a 3-column layout with animations.
        --Pricing Cards: Designed using Bootstrap grid with hover effects.
        --Contact Form: Centrally aligned for ease of use, with real-time form validation.
